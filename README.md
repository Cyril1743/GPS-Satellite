# Project 1: GPS Satellite

## Project Description

Air Pollution API concept:

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 8 Challenge. The purpose of this project was to build a gps satellite map for air pollution levels using our knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Air Pollution API provides current, forecast and historical air pollution data for any coordinates on the globe.

## User Story & Acceptance Criteria
