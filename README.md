# Project 1: GPS Satellite

## Project Description

NASA API + Maps API = search for location in google maps and pluglat and long into NASA Earth API to return the most recent Landsat imagery for that location.

## User Story & Acceptance Criteria

User Story:
As a user
I want to input an address
So that I can see the most recent landsat imagery and view it.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a polish website/ui/application
When I view the website
Then there is an input box

When an address is submitted
Then the most recent landsat imagery shows on the screen.

## APIs to be Used

Google Maps API and NASA Earth API

## Decomposition and Rough Breakdown of Tasks

## Project Requirements

With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You'll also learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.
You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
Use at least two server-side APIs
Links to an external site.
.
Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
Be responsive.
Have a polished UI.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
Presentation Requirements
Use this Project Presentation Template
Links to an external site.
to address the following:
Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
Demo: Show your stuff!
Directions for future development.
Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

## Grading Requirements

This project is graded based on the following criteria:
NOTE
If a project submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
A repository that has no code
